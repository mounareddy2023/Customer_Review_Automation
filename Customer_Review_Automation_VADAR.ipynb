    "explain VADAR library in SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\n",
    "\n",
    "The VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) library is a tool specifically designed for sentiment analysis in textual data. It is particularly adept at analyzing social media text, such as tweets and reviews, but is also effective on other types of text data. VADER is part of the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) and is widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness in detecting sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features of VADER\n",
    "Human-Curated Lexicon:\n",
    "\n",
    "VADER includes a lexicon of words with associated sentiment intensity scores. These scores range from -4 (most negative) to +4 (most positive). This lexicon was created by human experts who rated the intensity of words based on their perceived sentiment.\n",
    "Valence Shifting:\n",
    "\n",
    "VADER takes into account the effect of punctuation, capitalization, and degree modifiers (such as \"extremely\", \"very\", \"slightly\") on the sentiment intensity. For example, \"This is good!\" will have a different score compared to \"This is GOOD!!!\".\n",
    "Handling of Conjunctions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The library considers the impact of conjunctions like \"but\" that can shift the sentiment of a sentence. For instance, in the sentence \"The movie was good, but the ending was bad\", the sentiment after \"but\" has more weight.\n",
    "Emoji and Slang Recognition:\n",
    "\n",
    "VADER can understand and interpret emojis and common internet slang, enhancing its ability to accurately gauge sentiment from social media and informal text.\n",
    "SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\n",
    "The SentimentIntensityAnalyzer is the primary tool in VADER used for performing sentiment analysis. It provides a straightforward way to analyze text and categorize it into positive, negative, neutral, or compound sentiment scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "How SentimentIntensityAnalyzer Works\n",
    "Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "You first need to initialize the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from the VADER library.\n",
    "Polarity Scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "The polarity_scores method of SentimentIntensityAnalyzer is used to get a dictionary of scores for a given text. The dictionary contains:\n",
    "pos: Positive sentiment score.\n",
    "neu: Neutral sentiment score.\n",
    "neg: Negative sentiment score.\n",
    "compound: A normalized score that sums up the overall sentiment of the text. The compound score ranges from -1 (most extreme negative) to +1 (most extreme positive).\n",
    "Example of Using SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate how the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer works:\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\n",
    "import nltk\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ensure VADER lexicon is downloaded\n",
    "nltk.download('vader_lexicon')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\n",
    "sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example text\n",
    "text = \"The movie was great, but the ending was terrible!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Analyze the sentiment\n",
    "scores = sia.polarity_scores(text)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(scores)\n",
    "\"\"\"Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "{'neg': 0.297, 'neu': 0.466, 'pos': 0.237, 'compound': -0.296}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "The neg score (0.297) indicates the proportion of the text that is negative.\n",
    "The neu score (0.466) indicates the proportion of the text that is neutral.\n",
    "The pos score (0.237) indicates the proportion of the text that is positive.\n",
    "The compound score (-0.296) is the overall sentiment score, suggesting that the sentiment is slightly negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "VADER and its SentimentIntensityAnalyzer provide a robust, simple-to-use tool for sentiment analysis. \n",
    "It leverages a well-curated lexicon and sophisticated rules to accurately gauge the sentiment of text data, \n",
    "making it particularly useful for social media and review analysis.\n",
